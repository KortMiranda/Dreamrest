# Dreamrest

## Description

Dreamrest is inspired by Pinterest, but this app focuses on collecting images and quotes for vision boards to keep users motivated in reaching their personal goals. This repo is still a work in progress but the final plan is to make this into a fully functional social media platform that is designed to create a positive atmosphere where users can create their potential future life with “dream cards” and others can cheer them on or be inspired by them.
