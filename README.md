# Dreamrest

## Description

Dreamrest is inspired by Pinterest, but this app focuses on collecting images and quotes for vision boards to keep users motivated in reaching their personal goals. This repo is still a work in progress but the final plan is to make this into a fully functional social media platform that is designed to create a positive atmosphere where users can create their potential future life with “dream cards” and others can cheer them on or be inspired by them.

## User Stories

* As the user, I would like to have a landing page for the app that will allow me to either sign up for a new account or log into my current account.
* As the user, I would like to see all the dream cards of the people I follow on the home page. ( kind of done)
* As the user, if I see a dream card that I like on the main page, I would like to click a heart button on the card to indicate I like the content, or I can add the content onto my own dream board with the save button.
* As the user, if I find a card that I might be interested in adding onto my board, I would like to click on it from the home screen and the content to be enlarged to see the image better or view the details of the card. I should also be able to save and like the card from there if I decide to do so at that point. 
* As the user, I would like to add comments to the cards I find if I wish to add them. 
* As the user, I would like to upload my own images to add to my dream board to personalize my own dreams and visions of my future outcome. 
* As the user, if I find another Dreamrest user that I really like, I would like to be able to follow them and see what content they are posting.
* As the user, when I click on my profile picture on the nav bar, I want to be directed to a page with all the dream cards that I have collected.
* As the user, I would like the ability to delete a dream card from my profile if I so desire to.
